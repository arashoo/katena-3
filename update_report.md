# Glass Inventory Update Report

## Summary
The HTML table data has been successfully synchronized with the backend `glasses.json` file.

## Update Statistics
- **Total glasses in updated file**: 551 entries
- **New glass entries created**: 106
- **Existing entries updated**: 251
- **Backup created**: `backend/data/glasses_backup.json`

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Stock Count Updates
The script updated stock counts for existing glasses to match the current inventory in your HTML table. Examples:
- 35x39 Clear: 359 → 1 (multiple size updates)
- 40x39 Clear: 420 → 5
- 42x52 Clear: 1 → 13
- 48x52 Clear: 209 → 2

### 2. New Glass Entries Created
Added 106 new glass types that were in your HTML but missing from the JSON:
- Various sizes like 41x22, 42x22, 43x22 Clear
- New 68mm height glasses: 21x68, 23x68, 24x68, etc.
- Multiple 40mm height variants: 27x40, 28x40, 30x40, etc.
- New 54mm height glasses: 29x54, 27x54, 36x54, etc.

### 3. Reserved Projects
The script parsed reserved project information from the HTML and updated the JSON entries with:
- Project names like QUEEN, ROCKWELL, STOCK, WESTMOUNT, etc.
- Reserved project arrays in the JSON structure

### 4. Rack Locations
Updated rack locations where provided in the HTML data.

## Data Structure Maintained
The script preserved the existing JSON structure:
- Unique glass IDs (e.g., "35x39_clear_group")
- All required fields: width, height, color, heatSoaked, count, availableCount, reservedCount
- Reserved projects and rack information
- Consistent 6mm thickness for new entries

## Backup Safety
A backup of your original file was created at:
`backend/data/glasses_backup.json`

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Your backend now has current inventory data
2. ✅ New glass types from your Excel are now in the system
3. ✅ Stock counts are synchronized
4. The web application should now show accurate inventory data

## Files Updated
- `backend/data/glasses.json` - Main inventory file (updated)
- `backend/data/glasses_backup.json` - Backup of original data (created)

The synchronization is now complete! Your JSON database matches your current HTML inventory table.
