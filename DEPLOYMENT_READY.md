## 📋 QUICK DEPLOYMENT STEPS

- **Upload all files** from the `deployment-files` folder

### 2. Set Up Node.js App
- Go to **"Node.js Apps"** in cPanel
- Click **"Create Application"**
- **Application Root:** point to your upload folder
- **Startup File:** `server.js`
- **Node.js Version:** 14.x or higher

### 3. Install Dependencies

- Or use terminal: `npm install`

### 4. Start Application
- Click **"Restart"** in the Node.js interface
- Visit your domain to see the app running!

## 🌐 HOW IT WORKS

- **Frontend:** Served as static files from `/dist` folder
- **Backend API:** Available at `/api/*` endpoints
- **Data Storage:** JSON files in `/data` folder
- **Single Server:** One Node.js app serves everything

## 🔧 IMPORTANT SETTINGS

- **File Permissions:** Ensure `/data` folder is writable (755 or 775)
- **SSL Certificate:** Enable HTTPS for your domain
- **Backup:** Regular backup of `/data` folder recommended

## 📞 TESTING

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- `yourdomain.com` ← Main application
- `yourdomain.com/api/health` ← API health check

## 🎯 WHAT'S CONFIGURED

✅ Production-optimized React build
✅ Express server with static file serving
✅ API endpoints for all inventory functions
✅ JSON file-based data storage
✅ Error handling and logging
